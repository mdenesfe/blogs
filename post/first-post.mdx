## introduction

the `printf` function is a widely used C library function that is used to print text to the standard output. it's a powerful and flexible function that allows developers to format and print text in a variety of ways. but have you ever wondered how the `printf` function works under the hood? In this article, we will take a deep dive into the `ft_printf` project, a recreation of the `printf` function that was created to understand the inner workings of the original function.

## background

the `ft_printf` project was created as a learning exercise to understand the inner workings of the `printf` function. the goal of the project was to create a similar function from scratch, using only the C language and a few helper functions. the function takes a string and a list of arguments and prints them to the standard output. the code includes several helper functions such as `ft_putchar`, `ft_putstr`, `ft_putnbr`, `ft_putadd`, and `ft_putnbr_hex`, which are used to handle various types of input.

## how it works


the `ft_printf` function starts by initializing the variable argument list using `va_start`. then, it initializes a variable `len` to keep track of the number of characters printed. the function then iterates through the input string and checks for the presence of the '%' character, which indicates that the next character is a conversion specifier. if '%' is found, the function calls the `choose` function passing the next character and the variable argument list as arguments. the `choose` function then determines which of the conversion specifiers is used and calls the appropriate helper function. if the '%' character is not found, the function simply prints the current character. the variable argument list is closed using `va_end`. finally, the function returns the number of characters printed.

### supported conversion specifiers

- `%c`: single character
- `%s`: string
- `%p`: pointer address
- `%d`: signed decimal integer
- `%i`: signed decimal integer
- `%u`: unsigned
- `%x`: unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase)
- `%X`: unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)

### flags

- `'0'`: zero padding
- `'-'`: left alignment
- `'+'`: signed numbers must always begin with a sign
- `' '`: signed numbers should begin with a sign or a space
- `'#'`: alternate form
- `'*'`: field width is specified as an argument
- `'.'`: precision is specified as an argument

## examples

here's an example of how to use the `ft_printf` function:

```c
ft_printf("hello, %s!\n", "world");
ft_printf("the answer is %d\n", 42);
ft_printf("%x in hex is %d in decimal\n", 255, 255);

```

output:

```c
hello, world!
the answer is 42
ff in hex is 255 in decimal

```
